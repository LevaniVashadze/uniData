# University Ranking

When I was researching universities the rankings of universities wasn't available or was based on old data (2013, 2017), so based on the official 2025 data from NAEC, I made a small website using streamlit where I share a small analysis of the data.
The data has the grant percentage and the university and faculty, based on this information I calculated the average grant percentage per university and per program, so future students can see an approximate ranking of the Universities. The data has some flaws
but in general is a good indicator of the university and the program.
